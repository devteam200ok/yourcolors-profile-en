# Your Colors

**Your Colors** is a digital-textile-printing licensing & production platform, operated by **Taihan Textile Co., Ltd.** (대한방직), a Korean textile company with over 70 years of heritage. Designers upload their pattern designs, and through our platform they can license their designs — then those patterns are printed, processed, and delivered worldwide as high-quality fabrics.

## 🧵 What We Do — Platform Concept

- Designers upload pattern designs (digital files) to the platform.  
- Those designs are licensed: designers earn licensing fees when their patterns are ordered.  
- Once an order is placed, the fabric is printed at Taihan Textile’s Daegu factory, processed to high standards, and rolled/prepared for shipping worldwide.  
- Our service targets textile brands and manufacturers looking for high-quality custom fabrics — even small-volume orders, with fast turnaround, at a quality comparable to (or better than) traditional bulk production.

## 🏭 Digital Textile Printing — Our Approach & Advantages

We use **reactive dye–based digital textile printing** on pre-treated cotton, linen and similar natural fiber fabrics (not pigments, plastisol, or surface-only printing). The process includes:

- Pre-treatment of fabric (preparation to bond dye and fiber)  
- Inkjet printing of the design with reactive dyes  
- Post-print fixation (steam/heat), thorough washing, softening/tenter/calendar processing etc. — same finishing steps as traditional high-end screen/rotary printing.  

This ensures that colours are vibrant, durable, and permanently bonded into the fibre — giving **excellent wash and rub fastness, soft hand-feel, and longevity**.  [oai_citation:0‡Contrado UK](https://www.contrado.co.uk/blog/reactive-printing-advanced-method/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Benefits compared with traditional (screen / rotary) printing**:

| ✅ Benefit | 📌 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| Short-run flexibility | Digital print allows production from **1 yard** — no need to meet large minimum order (screen print often requires 1000 yards or more to justify setup)  [oai_citation:1‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_textile_printing?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |  
| Fast turnaround | Fabric production and finishing can be completed typically in **1–2 weeks**, while traditional screen/rotary printing may take ~2 months including screen making, setup, etc. |  
| High design flexibility | Supports complex, detailed, multi-color or even photographic patterns — infinitely customizable per order.  [oai_citation:2‡TISKA Fabrics](https://tiskafabrics.com/digital-textile-printing/?srsltid=AfmBOop8P9NfWWlUNU7HoQdZTtfRwptwqbWa28BqcT7El8P3UfGRJ_RX&utm_source=chatgpt.com) |  
| High-quality, durable finish | Because dyes chemically bond to the fibre (instead of just coating the surface), resulting fabric maintains softness and wash-fastness comparable to or better than traditional methods.

- Textile brands (fashion, apparel, home textiles) who need **small-to-medium volume runs with custom patterns**  
- Designers / pattern artists who want to **monetize their designs globally**, via licensing + production  
- Startups or small brands seeking **low-risk prototyping** or limited-run capsule collections  
- Companies needing **quick turnaround and flexibility in color/design** — e.g. seasonal collections, limited editions

- Bridging “designer creativity ↔ industrial-grade textile production & global distribution” — enabling global reach for independent designers.  
- Lower barrier to entry compared to traditional textile production (no need for large MOQs, no screen-making costs, faster lead times).  
- High quality finish: reactive dye printing + full finishing process results in premium fabric feel and durability — suitable even for high-end fashion or home décor.  
- Licensing business model: enables passive income for designers, democratizing textile design.

## 📦 Production & Fulfillment Workflow (Proposed)

1. Designer uploads pattern (seamless-repeat or flat design) on Your Colors platform  
2. Customer (brand / manufacturer) selects design, fabric type (cotton, linen, etc.) and order quantity — can start from as little as 1 yard  
3. Order sent to Taihan Textile’s Daegu factory → Digital printing with reactive-dye ink on pre-treated fabric → Post-treatment (steaming/fixing, washing, tenter/ calendar / softening) → Quality inspection & rolling  
4. Finished fabric is rolled and packaged for global shipping → Customer receives fabric ready for manufacturing (garment, home textile, etc.)  
5. Designer earns licensing royalties from order

## ℹ️ Notes / Key Tech Details

- We use **reactive dye digital printing** (not pigment-surface printing) to ensure vivid colour, high wash-fastness and soft hand-feel.  [oai_citation:4‡Contrado UK](https://www.contrado.co.uk/blog/reactive-printing-advanced-method/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Because dye bonds into the fibre, the colours remain vibrant and stable even after repeated washing — equivalent or superior to traditional screen/rotary printing on natural fibre fabrics.  [oai_citation:5‡Contrado UK](https://www.contrado.co.uk/blog/reactive-printing-advanced-method/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Digital textile printing enables **small-volume (1 yard) orders** and **fast turnaround**, making it ideal for sampling, limited-edition runs, or custom designs.  [oai_citation:6‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_textile_printing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
